Create your repository on GitHub

Create your Unity project.

Configure the following settings.  

Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor -> Asset Serialiaztion = Force Text

Edit -> Project Settings -> Version Control -> Mode = Visible Meta Files

They are the default settings for my version of Unity, but it's good to verify.

Navigate to your project directory in your preferred git tool.  

Run git init

Create a .gitignore using the [example .gitignore](./1_example_gitignore.md)

Follow the normal add/commit/set remote/push
