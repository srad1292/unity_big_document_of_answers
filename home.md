# Unity Big Document of Answers

## 1. Description

This markdown documentation serves as a place for me to collect every question I have about how to accomplish something in Unity along with the answers I find.  The caveat is this will not necessarily be the perfect way to solve said problem or the only good way to solve said problem.  If I find that one of the answers I document actually is really bad for performance, I will make a note of it.  If I then find a better way to accomplish what I was trying to do, I will update the answer to include that, while leaving the old answer there with the note of performance issues.
